# Automating CI/CD Pipeline for Spring Boot Application Deployment on AWS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Spring Boot application on AWS.

## Steps
1. Set up the Spring Boot application.
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
3. Deploy the application on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven
- AWS Account
- GitHub Account

## Next Steps

4. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   - Push your Spring Boot application code to a GitHub repository.  
   - Ensure the repository is public or provide necessary access for CI/CD workflows.

5. **Set Up GitHub Actions**  
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project.  
   - Add a YAML file to define the CI/CD workflow.  
   - Configure build, test, and deployment steps.

6. **Configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
   - Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for your application.  
   - Generate an AWS access key and secret key for deployment.  
   - Use the AWS CLI or Elastic Beanstalk console for setup.

7. **Integrate AWS with GitHub Actions**  
   - Add AWS credentials to GitHub repository secrets.  
   - Update the workflow file to use AWS CLI commands for deployment.

8. **Test the Pipeline**  
   - Push changes to the repository and verify the pipeline execution.  
   - Ensure the application is successfully deployed on AWS.
